[![Deploy static Storybook content to Pages](https://github.com/fdevillard/svelte-datepicker/actions/workflows/storybook.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fdevillard/svelte-datepicker/actions/workflows/storybook.yml)

A toy repo to play with Svelte and Storybook.

Storybook is pubolished [here](https://fdevillard.github.io/svelte-datepicker/) using Github actions.

It's expected to have two date pickers:

- one from the [date-picker-svelte](https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-picker-svelte) project,
- another custom one.

Both will be added in storybook. But, currently, only some stories of the public-repos are created.

## How to run storybook locally:

```
npm run storybook
```
